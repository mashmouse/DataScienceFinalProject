# DataScienceFinalProject

We conduct statistical analysis on the "R questions on Stack Overflow" datasets from Kaggle to find which variables contribute most to the probability of an answer being accepted as correct or not by the question asker. 
We also construct a simple CART model to use the most influential explanitory variables to predict if it is likely that a Stack Overflow answer may be accepted.
